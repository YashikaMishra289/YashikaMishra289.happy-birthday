For the best mother ever, 
A Very Happy Birthday. May this year be full of joy and contentment, and may you be happy and healthy. May all your wishes come true.
I want you to know that you are the best mother one could ask for. I appreciate everything you have done for me and aspire to make you happy and proud. 
Thank you, Neeta Dixit, the most honourable woman in the world.
Happy Birthday again, and many happy returns of the day.
